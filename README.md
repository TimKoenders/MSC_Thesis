# 1 Research Questions

1. How do political party preferences towards climate policy, as derived from manifesto analysis, correlate with the actual implementation of climate policies in different countries and election periods?

2. What patterns and trends can be discerned by creating a comprehensive party preference index and examining its relationship with real-world climate policy outcomes?

# 2 Introduction

This research employs text mining techniques to analyze political party manifestos from the Manifesto Project across diverse countries and election periods. The study aims to create a nuanced party preference index, measuring each party's stance on government intervention for environmentally sustainable economic practices. 

Manifestos from various countries and election periods are subjected to advanced text-mining techniques, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis. Topic modeling may help objectively categorize and visualize the ideas political parties are promoting while sentiment analysis has the potential to show each political partyâ€™s attitude towards a policy idea. This process yields sentiment scores and topic relevance scores, forming the basis for a comprehensive party preference index. The party preference index is weighted based on party vote shares to account for varying bargaining power of parties in political coalitions, resulting in a final country-election-specific index. We then use this index to explain how many climate policies governments implement each election period.

By correlating this index with real-world data on climate policies, this project builds upon political economy theory and investigates patterns and trends, providing data-driven insights into the impact of political ideologies on environmental policy outcomes.
